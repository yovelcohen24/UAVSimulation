Autonomous UAV Simulation
This project simulates the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as they autonomously navigate and orbit points of interest based on a sequence of commands from input files. Each UAV operates according to a set of parameters, receiving target locations and commands that dictate its movement pattern and orientation. The simulation records the movement data for each UAV, outputting it in separate log files.

Project Overview
The goal of the simulation is to model UAVs that travel toward designated points of interest and then maintain a circular orbit around them. Each UAV operates autonomously, adjusting its path based on a constant speed and initial direction. Upon reaching a target, the UAV shifts to an orbital movement around the point, logging its position data in real-time.
